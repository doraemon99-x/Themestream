<div id="synopsis">
<p>Beryl Gardernant is a humble sword master who runs a dojo in the Reveris Kingdom.<br />

He had come to terms with the limits of his strength and was living a leisurely life in the countryside.<br />

However, his life changes drastically when Alexia, one of his former students, suddenly visits him and tells him that she has recommended Beryl to be a special instructor within the nation’s Knight Order.<br />

He is reunited with his former students who have become big-shots such as knight captains, top-ranking adventurers, and ace magicians, and he is kicked out of his family’s dojo.<br />

Turbulent times were ahead of him.<br />

Beryl was happy that his former disciples adore him, but he is also humble about the fact that he is not very strong.<br />

However, while he wasn’t aware of it, he was the owner of an unparalleled talent.<br />

Unconscious of his power, Beryl is surrounded by ex-disciples who know of his strength, and gradually makes himself known to the world, all the while remaining rather unaware of all of this.<br />
